This repository contains the code for the article 'Cosmological Horizons' published on medium.com in 'Cosmic Cartography' publication.

The notebook is small enough to load with the outputs, so they were kept in.

The Python and relevant libraries versions are in the requirements.txt. Please bear in mind, those are not actual requirements - it can potentially run on a range of versions - this is just what I've been running it on.
